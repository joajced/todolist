# TodoMaster, a simple web app for increased productivity

## What is TodoMaster and how does it work?

TodoMaster is a web app that allows you to add and keep track of tasks, and to classify them into distinct projects. Each individual task can be marked as done, modified or deleted if not needed anymore. Additionally, the app displays how many tasks have been completed and how many there are in total for each project, giving the user an overview of the work done and the work to do.

## What is the purpose of this project?

I started this project as a way to apply my newly gained knowledge of the Java programming language as well as backend tools, such as the Spring Boot framework. Since September 2024, it has slowly been improved and expanded as I learned more about APIs and databases. The development of this project has also been a great opportunity to learn to use software tools not specific to Java development including Git, Maven, JavaScript and Docker.

## How was the project developed?

The backend for this app was built with:

- Java
- Spring Boot
- H2 Database Engine
- Jakarta Persistence (JPA)
- Hard work and dedication

The frontend, on the other hand, was created using standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Since the focus of this project is not to showcase my frontend skills, it is only as good as it needs to be and the UX is far from optimal. Yet it allows the user to interact with the database in a simple and intuitive way.
